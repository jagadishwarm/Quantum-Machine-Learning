# Quantum-Machine-Learning
Learning Quantum Machine Learning from EDx course "University_of_TorontoX UTQML101x Quantum Machine Learning"
I have started Quantum Machine Learing from edX cource "UTQML101x: Quantum Machine Learning instructed by Peter Wittek" I will keep on adding content based on my understanding and cource material for my personal learing purpose.
# Goal to Learn
. Distinguish between quantum computing paradigms relevant for machine learning

. Assess expectations for quantum devices on various time scales

. Identify opportunities in machine learning for using quantum resources

. Implement learning algorithms on quantum computers in Python

# Things I should know 
I should do a refresher on the following topics for better understanding Linear algebra, complex numbers, calculus, intermediate Python. One of the following is highly recommended: statistical mechanics, quantum physics, machine learning.

# Topics to learn
1: Quantum Systems

2: Quantum Computation

3: Classical-Quantum Hybrid Learning Algorithms

4: Coherent Learning Protocols
